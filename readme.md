## About
CNF.h contains the parser, negation normal form, distributive functions and a function to find the main connective.
Resolve.h contains the clause class.
It implements the user resolution and automated resolution as well as tautology checking.
ResolutionDlg.h and .cpp are automatically generated files that I edited to implement the interface.
Automated.txt is the file that has the output clauses from the input clauses that took it 1271 clauses to reach a contradiction.
Manual.txt is the file that has the output clauses for the same input, but from the user resolution side.
